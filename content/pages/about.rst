:slug: about

I am **Steven Esser**, a site reliability engineer at PreciseTarget_, a data
science company helping retailers improve conversion across channels.

Previously, I was a senior software engineer at Genesys_, working on core
platform services using Python. Before that, I was a developer at nexB_ where I
worked on automating software composition analysis and building open-source
communities, among other things. My interests include general computing,
open-source software and service reliability.
